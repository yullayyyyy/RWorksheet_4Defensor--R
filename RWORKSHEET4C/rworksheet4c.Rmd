```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. a. Show your solutions on how to import a csv file into the environment.
```{r}
library(readr)

open_mpg <- read.csv("mpg.csv")
open_mpg
```

1b. Which variables from mpg dataset are categorical?
```{r}
str(open_mpg)
```
ans. manufacturer, model, trans, drv, fl, class variables are categorical

1c. Which are continuous variables?
ans. X, displ, year, cyl, cty, hwy are continuous variables

2. Which manufacturer has the most models in this data set? Which model has the most variations? Show your answer.
```{r}

manufacturer_counts <- table(open_mpg$manufacturer)



most_models_manufacturer <- as.character(names(manufacturer_counts)[which.max(manufacturer_counts)])


model_counts <- table(open_mpg$model)


most_variations_model <- as.character(names(model_counts)[which.max(model_counts)])


print(paste("The manufacturer with the most models is:", most_models_manufacturer))
print(paste("The model with the most variations is:", most_variations_model))
```


2a. Group the manufacturers and find the unique models. Show your codes and result.
```{r}
dfmpg <- data.frame(Manufacturer = open_mpg$manufacturer, Model = open_mpg$model)
unique_mpg <- unique(dfmpg)
unique_mpg

```

2b. Graph the result by using plot() and ggplot(). Write the codes and its result
```{r}

library(ggplot2)

factoredManufacturer <- as.factor(unique_mpg$Manufacturer)
manufacturerPlot <- plot(as.factor(factoredManufacturer),
                 main = "Unique Model per Manufacturer",
                 cex.names = 0.8, las = 2)



library(dplyr)

unique_count <- unique_mpg %>%
  count(unique_mpg$Manufacturer)
unique_count

names(unique_count) <- c("Manufacturer", "Number of Models")
unique_count

ggplot(unique_count, aes(x = Manufacturer, y = `Number of Models`)) +
geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "violet")+ theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

```
  


2.Same dataset will be used. You are going to show the relationship of the modeland the manufacturer.
2a.What does ggplot(mpg, aes(model, manufacturer)) + geom_point() show?
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(open_mpg, aes(model, manufacturer)) + geom_point()+ theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

```
ans. Plots the mpgdataset with model on the x-axis and manufacturer on the y-axis. Each point represents a car model

2b. For you, is it useful? If not, how could you modify the data to make it more informative?

It's useful to know how many models each manufacturer produces.
To make it more interesting, I can color code each point based on the class variable and add a label using the cty variable.


3. Plot the model and the year using ggplot(). Use only the top 20 observations. Write the codes and its results.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

Aobj <-head(open_mpg, 20)
Aobj

ggplot(data = Aobj, aes(x = year, y = model, color = as.factor(model))) +
 geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
 labs(title = "Relationship between Model, Year, and Manufacturer",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Model",
       color = "Manufacturer") +
 theme_minimal()

```

4. Using the pipe (%>%), group the model and get the number of cars per model. Show codes and its result.
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

head(open_mpg, 20)


open_mpg %>%
 group_by(model) %>%
 summarize(count = n()) -> grouped_open_mpg


grouped_open_mpg

```

4a. Plot using geom_bar() using the top 20 observations only. The graphs should have a title, labels and colors. Show code and results.
```{r}
mpg_observation_top20 <- head(grouped_open_mpg, 20)

mpg_observation_top20  <- ggplot(mpg_observation_top20, aes(x = model, y = count, fill = model)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Number of Cars per Model",
       x = "Model" ,
       y = "Number of cars")+ theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))


mpg_observation_top20
```


4b. Plot using the geom_bar() + coord_flip() just like what is shown below. Show codes and its result.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
mpg_top20 <- ggplot(grouped_open_mpg, aes(x = model, y = count, fill = model)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Number of Cars per Model",
       x = "Model" ,
       y = "Number of cars") +
  coord_flip()

mpg_top20
```

5.Plot the relationship between cyl - number of cylinders and displ - engine displacement using geom_point with aesthetic color = engine displacement. Title should be “Relationship between No. of Cylinders and Engine Displacement”.
```{r}

relationship_cyl_displ <- ggplot(open_mpg, aes(x = cyl,
                                               y = displ,
                                               color = displ)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Relationship between No. of Cylinders and Engine Displacement",
       x = "Number of Cylinders",
       y = "Engine Displacement")

relationship_cyl_displ

```
5a. How would you describe its relationship? Show the codes and its result.

The scatter figure illustrates the relationship between engine displacement and cylinder count, showing that larger engines with more cylinders often have higher displacement. As cylinder count increases, so does the displacement.

6. Plot the relationship between displ (engine displacement) and hwy(highway miles per gallon). Mapped
it with a continuous variable you have identified in #1-c. What is its result? Why it produced such
output?

```{r}
displ_hwy_relationship <- ggplot(open_mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cty)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Relationship between Engine Displacement and Highway MPG",
       x = "Engine Displacement",
       y = "Highway MPG")

displ_hwy_relationship
```
Each point in the scatterplot represents a city's fuel efficiency, and it displays the relationship between engine displacement and highway miles per gallon. Insight into vehicle fuel efficiency for various engine sizes can be gained by visualizing the relationship between various city fuel efficiency levels and displ and hwy.


6.Import the traffic.csv onto your R environment.
a.How many numbers of observation does it have? What are the variables of the traffic dataset the Show your answer.
```{r}
library(readr)
traffic <- read.csv("traffic.csv")

num_obs <- nrow(traffic)
num_obs

num_vars <- ncol(traffic)
num_vars

vars <- colnames(traffic)
vars

```

6b. subset the traffic dataset into junctions. What is the R codes and its output?
```{r}

junctions_subset1 <- subset(traffic, Junction == 1)

junctions_subset2 <- subset(traffic, Junction == 2)

junctions_subset3 <- subset(traffic, Junction == 3)

junctions_subset4 <- subset(traffic, Junction == 4)

```

junction_plot_1 <- ggplot(junctions_subset1,
                          aes(x = as.Date(junctions_subset1$DateTime),
                              y = Vehicles)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b-%Y") + theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = "Junction 1", x = "Time", y = "Number of Vehicles")

junction_plot_1

junction_plot_2 <- ggplot(junctions_subset2,
                          aes(x = as.Date(junctions_subset2$DateTime),
                              y = Vehicles)) +

                              y = Vehicles)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b-%Y") + theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = "Junction 3", x = "Time", y = "Number of Vehicles")

                          aes(x = as.Date(junctions_subset4$DateTime),
                              y = Vehicles)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b-%Y") + theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = "Junction 4", x = "Time", y = "Number of Vehicles")

junction_plot_4
```

alexa_Month <-open_alexa_data%>%
  count(month)
alexa_Month

alexa_monthly_reviews <- table(alexa_Month)
alexa_monthly_reviews

alexa_lineplot <- ggplot(alexa_Month, aes(x = month, y = n, group = 1)) +
